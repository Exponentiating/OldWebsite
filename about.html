		<h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
		<p>Hey there! My name is Siv Kyne, and I'm a Chinese person living in the United States.</p>
		<p>First off, I was adopted from China when I was an infant, so I don't speak Chinese. But I do speak some Spanish! I took various curricula of Spanish lessons for roughly five years. And, unbeknownst to many people, I live on a farm out in the country with lots of cows. And of course, we also have four house cats. They're awesome.</p>
		<p>As you may know, on the other hand, I am a seasoned artist who's been doing digital illustration since 2016. I've also done a lot of story writing; I hope to publish a novel within the next couple of years! Plus, I've been a musician since 2014, but I just recently began producing music in FL Studio in October of 2023. I'm already making some cool stuff, like hardwave.</p>
		<p>My goal with producing is to interweave my art, writing, and music into multiple different cinematic masterpieces. I've already released the two songs "Letter from the Princess" and "Don't Fall With Her," which are parts of a larger narrative about young Jace falling for the Princess of Fuedecaif. Meanwhile, his life-long best friend Ren is trying to save him from this fate. What will happen next?</p>
